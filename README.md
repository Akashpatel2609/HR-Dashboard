# HR Dashboard

## Project Overview
The HR Dashboard project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of human resources data, offering both summary insights and detailed employee records. The dataset used in this project is generated using a combination of Claude prompts and the Python Faker library. It includes various HR-related data points such as demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data.

## Resources
- **Icons & Images** – The icons used in this project are sourced from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) and customized using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) to match the dashboard’s color scheme. The PSD (Photopea files) can be found in the `icon` folder within the ZIP file for further editing.
- **Mockups** – The initial dashboard mockup was created using the Procreate app on a tablet. Additionally, the dashboard container mockups were designed using [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/).
- **Tableau Project File** – The project file created during the course is included in the ZIP file. You can also directly access the Tableau file from my [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/akash.patel3574/vizzes).

## User Story
As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

## Dashboard Sections
### Summary View
The summary view consists of three main sections:

#### 1. Overview
- Displays the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.
- Visualizes the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.
- Presents a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
- Compares total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ).
- Shows the distribution of employees by city and state.

#### 2. Demographics
- Presents the gender ratio in the company.
- Visualizes the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
- Displays the total number of employees within each age group.
- Shows the total number of employees within each education level.
- Highlights the correlation between employees’ educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.

#### 3. Income Analysis
- Compares salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify discrepancies or patterns.
- Analyzes how age correlates with salary across different departments.

### Employee Records View
- Provides a comprehensive list of all employees, including details such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.
- Users can filter the list based on any available column to refine their search results.
